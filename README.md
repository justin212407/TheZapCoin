# Zapcoin: Decentralized Energy Finance Platform

> *Where Clean Energy Meets DeFi*
> A Solana-powered platform that combines Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) with renewable energy repayment.

The Project is live at - https://thezapcoin-official.netlify.app/

## Overview

Zapcoin is a revolutionary DeFi platform built on the Solana blockchain that connects renewable energy production with financial services. The platform allows users to:

1. *Buy Now, Pay Later with Energy*: Make purchases using BNPL smart contracts and repay loans using energy credits generated from renewable energy sources.
2. *Energy-to-Credit Conversion*: Convert renewable energy production (measured in kWh) into "eZap" tokens with financial value.
3. *DePIN Integration*: Verify energy production in real-time through IoT devices connected to renewable energy sources.
4. *Energy Marketplace*: Trade tokenized energy credits on a decentralized marketplace.
5. *ZapCoin Token Utility*: Use the native token for marketplace transactions, governance, and rewards.

## Project Structure

- *Frontend*: React-based UI with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- *Smart Contracts*: Solana programs written in Rust using the Anchor framework
- *Wallet Integration*: Support for Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana wallets
